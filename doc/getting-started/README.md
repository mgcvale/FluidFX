# Getting started with FluidFX

To get started with fluidFX, you can start by checking the guides on [how to install it](installation.md).

After that, I suggest you read the [Core Concepts page](core-concepts.md). It provides all the basics needded to build
pretty much anything with FluidFX.

If you want to dig deeper into FluidFX later, you can also check the [API reference guide](../api), and if you want to
see FluidFX working in practice, take a look at the [Examples](../examples).
